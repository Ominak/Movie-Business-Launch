**Project Overview**

This project provides data-driven insights to guide a new movie studio's strategy, helping them maximize success in the competitive film industry. By analyzing historical movie performance data, we identify key trends in genres, budgets, release timing, and audience reception to minimize risk and optimize profitability.

**Business Problem**

Entering the film industry as a new studio presents major challenges:
 1. High Investment Risk: Film production requires substantial capital, and a single unsuccessful film can severely impact a new studio's viability.
 2. Lack of Market Insight: Identifying what makes a movie financially successful (e.g., genre, budget, runtime, critical reception, audience popularity) is complex.
 3. Strategic Uncertainty â€“ The studio needs clarity on:

    -  Which movie genres perform best.
    - Optimal budget allocation

    - Best release timing (month/season)

    - Audience preferences (ratings, runtime.)

**Data Understanding**

**Data Source**:  
  The data was sourced from following sources  
  Box Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/ )  
IMDb (https://www.imdb.com/)   
Rotten Tomatoes (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/ )  The Movie DB(https://www.themoviedb.org/)  
The Numbers (https://www.the-numbers.com/ ) containing reviews, ratings,revenue figures and production budgets for various movies released previously.

  **Data Preparation**
  Data was cleaned to remove those without titles since would be impossible to use for any analysis.
